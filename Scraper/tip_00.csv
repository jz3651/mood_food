Lucy V.,5 star rating,1/10/2019,"I would happily eat the truffle tiramisu from Tipo 00 for the rest of my life. All the food was absolutely perfect, and the staff very helpful with food and wine suggestions. I had a special that was a beautiful rabbit ragu with fresh tagliatelle. Really high quality food for a modest price. Definitely get in early (we got there at about 5.45 and managed a table for 2) or book in advance, this place is very popular"
Andrew T.,4 star rating,2/19/2021,"Dropped in for lunch to Tipo 00. I've have been to the little coffee shop next door heaps of times and looked at Tipo 00 a couple of times and after finally having lunch here wish that I had of a long time ago as I could've been here several times by now. We enjoyed the food so much. Great service an nice little place with great ambiance and good food. We started with a couple of starters. The oysters were fresh and with a lovely vinaigrette and the arancini was crispy and  sat on a creamy sauce. Mains we had gnocchi with duck ragu and it was lovely. Small bobbles of gnocchi with lovely soft tender pieces of duck and rich sauce. Macaroni with spicy pork sausage and white beans. It was also very nice. Pasta cooked to perfection and the sausage was spicy without being too hot and the addition of the white beans also complimented the dish. The more of it you ate the better it was. We also had a side of polenta fritta these were crispy little soldiers and with a cheese dust and were good on there own but also good to soak up any sauces from the pasta dishes and a good choice to round the meal of with.  On arrival we were given complimentary bread and cheese as a starter and this was very nice as takes the edge off your hunger while waiting for your dishes. Overall a great place, good food and service and a lovely experience. The serving sizes were fine with out being too big big or small and we felt we had had a good lunch with out being too full. We will be happy to return here and also recommend it to others."
Ivy L.,4 star rating,11/28/2019,"I saw the amazing reviews for Tipo 00 so we wanted to try it out and take a break from having the amazing asian food all over town!  We tried to drop in early in the afternoon to get our names in the books but they said they were booked and told us to just come back and try to get one of the walk-ins at the bar.  We came on a weeknight around 7:30pm and the wait was still about an hour. We put our name down and decided to walk around a bit before coming back. They did take about an hour, maybe a little more, to seat us. Small restaurant that stays busy most of the night, unless you come in super late. Intimate and a nice ambiance, though the tables are a bit close together. We literally sat a few inches from the table next to us and the walk area is small! The house focaccia comes out hot and fresh with pesto and olive oil on top! It was warm and delicious! Too bad they only serve you one slice per person! We ordered the Tagliolini al Nero - squid ink pasta with squid and bottarga. Definitely the favorite of the dishes cause of the flavors. The noodles looked freshly made and the flavors were delicious! Perfect bite to the Tagliolini! I liked the small pieces of squid in the dish, tender and adds to the bite! 5/5The casarecce with pork sausage, white wine and radicchio was on the blander side compared to the other dish but the pasta was cooked well and I liked the sausage and radicchio in the dish! 4/5We had an Insalata of witlof,  cos lettuce and apples on the side to get some greens with the pasta. Liked the dressing ok this salad and the greens fee fresh. 4/5We liked the dishes and thought it was a lovely evening with reasonably priced foods that were fresh and delicious! The wait time was off putting and it was probably well worth it cause we would definitely come back. We were so stuffed we ordered the tipomisu to-go. We thought it was just a cake and didn't get much of the tiramisu/coffee flavors they come with this dessert. It was also fairly dense and less light and fluffy. Definitely had better tiramisu elsewhere! Pastas are on point though!"
Jim R.,4 star rating,2/5/2020,"Tiny Italian eatery serving beautifully prepared house made pastas and more.  We were visiting friends in Melbourne and I had located this spot online.  It wasn't really possible to get a reservation (apparently you've got to call quite a ways ahead), but we at stopped in anyway on a Tuesday night around 8:15 and were able to get a spot at one of the communal tables. I was very pleasantly surprised.  The place is buzzing with energy and the menu features truly Italian food with artisan ingredients and lots of care put into the dishes.  They have a number of starters but what caught my eye was the  house made pasta.  I got an amazing  pappadelle with a rich sauce and bits of braised beef-so good.  My wife savored the pasta with white wine and chicken.  To start they bring a few small slices of crispy focaccia and fresh ricotta cheese.This was a wonderful meal and reminded me of our many trips to Italy."
Rachel A.,4 star rating,12/22/2019,"Managed to walk in early enough without reservations to grab a table for two. Food was amazing so I would've given five stars but the service wasn't amazing. Felt like they were rushing us out so they could seat more people which is understandable but also not a great experience for us (and trust me, we hadn't been there long). Was definitely the best pasta I had in Melbourne during my stay so I recommend for anyone craving a good pasta!"
Ron W.,5 star rating,12/14/2018,"This place requires booking far in advance because it is no bigger than a 5 pound bag of Caputo ""00"" Flour and in high demand. At 6:00 PM it was stuffed tummy to tummy like a tray of Cannelloni. There are a few seats at the crowded Bar where you can have Elbow Pasta with real elbows in it. This is simply a simple little box packed as full as my carry-on after weeks of carrying on. Add 10 two-tops to the 6 seat Bar plus one small communal table with someone else's cheek in your date's jowl requires that you makes friends quickly. There is a tiny open kitchen and one dude hustling trays and buckets out the door to an offsite prep station (or a Roman Bar Mitzvah up the street). The Staff: Two attendants attending to you. Kelly was at my side like a playful Seal deftly balancing between moving dinner along and assisting with sorting through the options. You are allotted only 90 minutes to dine here, so practice eating to the beat. Instead of a tea candle on your table you get a Metronome and an egg timer. The Vibe: People who like people...very close. The Bar: Choose from 6 classic cocktails on page 1 of the Aussie/Italo Vino List. But one page is all you'll need as the choices are lovely and skillfully created. My Americano (how did they know? I dressed like a local), had Aperol (Rhubarb Liquer...Adderall might have been better), Compari, Sweet Vermouth, Soda served tall. It was tad bitter to start wit and tasted a bit like Pertussin on the finish but like both, you can get used to that quick enough and like it.  I switched up to a glass of Cocchi Chinato Vermouth. Sweet and lively as  a freshman Coed. Then, it was a Poderi Sangueneto Sangiovese which was an all purpose pick for the dinner on it's way. Say ciao to the chow: A house made Focaccia with dried Parsley, Ricotta Salata and a drizzle of Parsley Oil had a crunchy crust and a soft crumb. Push the Ricotta inside when no one's looking at you being a heathen. The Special Zucchini Flower stuffed with, yes, more Ricotta, and then tempura'ed was light and delightful. A quick fry is about all you can do with that so it must be done perfectly to measure up. It was. Otherwise it is a greasy limp cigar. It wasn't. Salumi (Chef's Choice) was Culatello, Soppressata, and Prosciutto, Chef picked all my favorite food groups. Even the small version of this was ample as each offering was piled as high as a relief map of the Blue Mountains. The Calamari came with seasonal Broad Beans (Favas to your American Cousins), came with mandolined Purple Peruvian Potatoes that remained crunchy despite being nestled among some Purple Potato Crisps, add some Squid Rings, that were so tender they must have quit swimming just to hop in the net. A squirt of Parsley Oil finished off this delectable dish. The Gnocchi di Pepato was mixed with large chunks of long braised lean Duck, Porcini Mushrooms, and Pecorino Pepato. These gnocchs were so soft I wanted to take then back to hotel room. (To swap for the down pillows, now take your head out of the gutter.)These feather light little puffs would have had the Medici dining with the Borgia's peacefully together on a regular basis. The Special Tagliatelle, with Butter, Parmigiano, and a generous shaving of White Winter Truffles, (the first of the season) was outstanding. Coming from the USA I was following the Truffle season like a Bruce Brown Surf Film. Forget surfing. Year round fresh Truffles? Better to catch those. Too full to make room for even the thought of dessert, Kelly swooped by with a sampler of Tipo-mirasu topped with a Chocolate Ganache which topped wonderful Marscapone Cheese, with Salted Caramel Sauce topping all of it. A one bite Fudge Cookie  topped me off. How will I have room for my Prilosec? Tipo-00, you're just my type."
Ying P.,4 star rating,3/26/2019,"I would have to say, this is one of my favourite pasta bar so far. The seat is limited and quite hard to get if you randomly walk-in with a busy hours or weekend so prepare to come early or make a reservation. The staffs quite nice and friendly. I've ordered a chef's menu which include 3 starters, 2 pasta, 1 salad and 2 deserts which I totally rrcommend it. Even though their starter is not that great, their pasta is out of this world! especially squid ink pasta with squid. they really know what they're doing on that. Many of yelp's reviewer raved about rheir tipo-misu but I still think it just ok.       After I come back to my place, I can tell you I still dreamt about that squid ink pasta!!!"
V C.,5 star rating,4/4/2018,"More pasta? Yes, Please. Rainy day and I escaped the hustle and bustle of Little Bourke street into this petite and moody Italian eatery, in what's going to be one of the most exciting lunch in my entire Melbourne trip.  As this was an impulse stop, I walked in without a reservation. Despite the massive popularity of this place, plus I was eating solo at the time, they proceed to seat me right away in the counter, facing a semi- open kitchen and watching all the actions are. I know right, grateful :). A couple slices of bread were given to ease my hunger as I perused the menu. The bread was simply divine and paired pleasantly with the ricotta cheese.For my lunch, I had what they are famous for: Tagliolini al Nero ($28) - Gorgeous presentation consisting of deep charcoal squid ink tagliolini, squid & bottarga. Both pasta and bottarga (salted, cured fish roe) did an amazing job appetizing my taste buds - it was very fresh, tasty and lightly seasoned, I enjoyed every bite of it! Further rounding out the lovely experience was the attentive and spot-on service. The pricing was a little steep considering the uber tiny portions given. Other than that, all is splendid with Tipo00 and I am personally looking forward to my future trip to Tipo00, with reservations of course :)"
Anchisa P.,4 star rating,9/23/2018,Very good pasta restaurant in Melbourne. We shared a few pasta dishes - asked the server for a recommendation and basically went with his suggestions. All the dishes are excellent.- Desserts are ok- Need to make a reservation
Stuart M.,5 star rating,6/5/2018,"This little gem of a restaurant has unadorned green walls, stretch tables, and generic chairs.  They are focused without distraction on the food.  Complementary focaccia slices with olive oil drizzled ricotta got the ball rolling.  That was followed by complimentary arancini rice balls over a piquant aioli.  Then our first item, broccolini came with a Parmesan, almond crumble. It was as good as it sounds.  Then they took it to the next level with squid ink tagliolini, strips of squid, and bottargo roe.  It came with an olive oil based sauce, and offered a quiet elegance from subtle ocean flavors.  We finished with John Dory filet over black rice, leeks and sorrel.Despite being a white fleshed fish, there was more character and nuance to this filet than many of the other varieties offer.  The leeks added a buttery onion note, and the rice had just the right texture and firmness.This kitchen operates with a sure hand.Our waitress was delightful, while offering expert service and attention.If only I had more capacity. Ah well, other choices will have to wait for next time."
Catharina I.,3 star rating,9/1/2017,"The food is not bad but I am not feeling that warm fuzzy five star feeling - difficult to describe but Tipo00 has never managed to wow me so I am going against the flow and not rate them 5 or even 4 stars.I came twice, first time on a Saturday evening, around 6 pm they told me the wait was until 9 pm, even for a one person bar seat. I decided to wait, as I wandered around the streets of Melbourne: they rang me at 8 pm saying that my table was ready. I had the black truffle risotto which I liked but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Curious because all the online praise, I decided to give the place another try on Monday after work - I called around 8.40 pm and was told to just step in but they couldn't guarantee a seat, when I arrived at 9.15 pm the place was still bustling but I was seated immediately. I went for the Tagliolini al nero followed by the Tipomisu. Again, the dishes were executed well but I wasn't impressed: to me this is just the way Italian food should be.Even though the service was good, I felt they gave me the evil eye for not drinking. Now, everyone who knows me a bit, knows that I am a lover of vino but I like to have the option not to drink. In addition, call me crazy but I didn't feel any love, the service was not bad but they did not make me feel welcome.So I gave them a chance twice, never was I super impressed but never did I have anything to complain either... I am sorry to say: I do not understand the hype and I am not really inclined to go back."
Pritika C.,4 star rating,1/31/2019,"Delicious food and friendly staff. Visited here for lunch on a weekday. The place is small, as everywhere else in the CBD, so it get can packed during prime time dining hours. I ordered the burrata for starters and a green pea tortellini for the main and both were delicious and light, but filling."
Rachel R.,5 star rating,2/1/2017,"Just as excellent as I had hoped - no wonder it's so hard to get a reservation!  We went for lunch around 1pm on a Thursday and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  (They book up several weeks in advance but they always have seats at the bar and the window for walk-ins, just know you'll be sitting on a tall stool.)Everything we had was excellent. There are plenty of vegetarian options, and it was hard to choose.The asparagus with parmesan mousse was a great start - a nice blend of creamy and salty flavors.  The truffle risotto special was heavenly.  I found a small portion was perfectly filling as my main.  The sides are not terribly large, so don't worry about it being too much food if you order one.  We loved the broccolini with almond and parmesan.  (The garnish was nice but the broccolini was perfectly cooked - tender but still some texture to it). And the gnocchi with braised duck was also great!Save room for dessert - their Tipomisu was fabulous. Think of it as a deconstructed tiramisu with the fantastic addition of salted caramel! Yum!Service was friendly and attentive - we didn't feel rushed nor did we ever feel like we had to wait too long to request the bill."
Reem A.,1 star rating,3/13/2018,"I took a friend (who just arrived australia) to have lunch here after all the reviews i read about it. She had dietary requirements (she don't eat pork for religious reasons) so we asked them to remove the pork and maybe add chicken instead. They refused, because and i quote ""we don't want people to come here and change our pizza"". That was so horrific and embarrassing for my friend. And to make it even worse they said they will take off the pork and put chicken on the side so she can ""sprinkle"" it LMAO. Dude under cover racism is on a whole new level in this place. I don't recommend you visit them if you have dietary requirements or inviting someone who is ""different"" for a bite :)Worst experience. (You guys are disgusting)"
Mary A.,5 star rating,10/14/2016,"Being a first timer diner in Melbourne, my friend & I were craving some good italiano after work. We found this place via yelp & decided to try our luck getting dinner walking in without a reservation. We got there just before 6 & to our surprise we just beat the rush! We were attended to a few seconds of entering & were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our waiter was friendly, professional & informed us of the specials very well without any hesitation. There wasn't a time throughout the evening where we felt neglected by the servers.The food that we had did not disappoint! My asparagus with parmesan cream mousse & watercress starter was light & delicious as the sharp flavour of the creamy dense mousse complimented the other elements on the plate. My squid ink main was also good to the point I was already enjoying the dishes' flavour upon it entering my mouth & having contact with my tastebuds before even starting the process of chewing it and digesting it :p The vanilla panna cotta with flavours of rhubarb, honey & lavender was fittingly sweet & seriously too pretty to eat but was also a nice way to finish the evening with the tasty savoury flavours we just devoured. Other: Complimentary appetizers are always praised in my books! // I find that one bill per table was more preferred, but they do allow split billing. // If you dont want to wait make sure you at least come in early to put yourself on the wait list as being seated near the door I heard it was a 1 & 3/4 hr wait for a table after 6-7pm // Overall it was a very good experience both the service & the food. Thank you Tipo 00 !"
Sheenal S.,4 star rating,8/26/2016,"This trendy tiny Italian place requires a booking or the other option is to get here at opening time at 5.30pm and put your name down. At 5.30pm on a Friday this place was already filling to capacity  and we were told a 60 minutes wait. We grabbed  at drink at portello DE rosso while we waited and we were called within 30 minutes for a seat at the bar. The menu is all in Italian with few options with each one being unique. There is pasta with flavours of fennel and saffron. There is gnocchi  with duck ragu. There is pasta with pork belly. We got calamari to start, which interestingly was not the traditional battered calamari but actual squid with deliciously flavoured lentils. We also got some complimentary  bread with  cheese to start.The gnocchi with duck  ragu was the best gnocchi  I've ever had. The duck was Uber tender.The nero  squid linguini  was delicately flavoured with bits of squid mixed  through.  Yum. Wish it had more bits of seafood  through it  Portion sizes are small like Italy so perhaps best to order a few dishes. Yummy food and quick service.Staff are good at clearing plates and getting you out the door as the queue  elongated quite quickly  and people crowd  inside  near the door"
Michael K.,1 star rating,4/28/2018,"Completely disappointed.We have eaten at Tipo 00 in the past and have loved the food and service and rated it highly on a number of reviewing sites.A couple of weeks ago I was on the computer and obviously using a third party site, I looked at Tipo 00 and read a few reviews and then went ahead and made a reservation via this site. I received a confirmation of a 7pm booking for Saturday 28th April 2018.Anyway we arrived at Tipo 00 at about 6:55pm and the girl at the front asked if we had a reservation, to which we replied, ""Yes"" and gave our name. She then walked over the someone in the kitchen area (I assume the owner and/or manger). He then came over conversation deteriorated to a point were we left disgruntled.Now I am sure the food is still delicious but it's not my fault that I used a third party online reviewing site and thought I had a legitimate reservation. I also understand that it's not the restaurants fault that this third party online review site is giving out books but I do feel that if I can understand the confusion, the rudeness of this guy is unacceptable. So as for the food on this occasion, I can't rate it... But when it comes to customer service Tips 00 is extremely poor on this occasion."
Tom W.,5 star rating,1/28/2018,"What a surprise to find this Italian tapas type restaurant deep in the heart of Melbourne.  The restaurant was busy when we first at 2:30 pm, however we were seated promptly in a very friendly manner.  Our server gave hints of her preferences with a telltale glitter of her eyes and a big smile when my wife asked about some items she found attractive.  That was a combination that resulted in a fabulous selection. Don't concern oneself what we ordered...go for what sounds good to you. I'll bet that turns into a winning selection."
Richard F.,5 star rating,4/27/2016,Well it's a hard place to get into but we went early just before 5 and had no problem. This place has so many 5 star reviews and is such a little gem we had to eat here while visiting Melbourne. It was also recommended by some locals so expectations were high and met. Very friendly staff and great service. Food was outstanding. We had the chefs special 5 course sampler and had a bunch of things we would never have ordered on our own - and all were exceptionally fantastic. Trout Sashimi Ox Tonge gnocchi dishBraised Rabbit pasta dish All crazy good and dessert was also fantastic. Highly recommended!
Matt R.,5 star rating,4/6/2019,"The best Italian food and probably the best food and drink pairings I've had here in Melbourne...well worth the wait to get a table....homemade pastas, desserts that'll make grand mama proud.....small spot so there are not many tables so go early n beat the crowd.....the staff was very helpful and their recommendations were spot on....."
Fred E.,5 star rating,3/16/2019,"Great dining experience! The burrata was awesome, with a perfect balance of textures between the creamy cheese, the crispy bread and the crunchy heirloom tomatoes. Also enjoyed the Palermo spritz and a reinvented tiramisu to finish on a sweet spot. Service is professional and efficient. Make sure to reserve in advance, the place is quite small and gets quickly crowded."
Jennifer T.,4 star rating,12/31/2017,"Amazing pasta dishes and worth coming for that. The space is cute but small. FOH wrote down the wrong phone number for us, and despite our hanging out in their sister bar next door while waiting for our table (as she recommended), claims she couldn't find us. When we finally went over to see why it was taking so long, they apparently needed another half hour to get us seats - so an hour and a half wait for what we were told would be 20 minutes. The starters fell flat - the octopus and asparagus - fortunately, the amazing pasta more than made up for it. We had the sausage tagliatelle and squid ink pasta with calamari - both stunners."
Scott V.,1 star rating,3/7/2019,Yep it's small.  Yes it's busy.  Wait staff not friendly.  There is too much good food in Melbourne to waste your time waiting for a table.
Kat D.,4 star rating,9/27/2017,"We decided to try Tipo 00 based on a recommendation from a friend and our travel book while we were in Melbourne.The menu is on the smaller sizer size, but they offer the traditional Italian classics that you'd expect.  I had the tortellini and my husband had the open-face lasagna. Prior to the entrees, we had polenta and fried eggplant with burrata cheese. The fried eggplant and cheese was delicious.The decor is minimal, and it is a rather small place, so it is clear the that focus is on the food. The portions are on the small side.Like another review stated for them, I gave them 4 stars because the service feels off. The staff are not welcoming;it is hard to put it in words but they're not rude but they're also not friendly or welcoming.  We barely got a smile or hello from the waitress, and even others bringing the dishes to the table we're not welcoming or cheery.  If they had more welcoming staff, I would have given them a 5, but the energy that the staff puts out there is not 5/5 worthy and actually is off putting."
Marc D.,4 star rating,2/28/2017,"Very popular and busy place. Excellent food, good atmosphere.Better make a reservation, otherwise you risk a 1Hr + waiting time.But the waiting is worth it."
Pying W.,4 star rating,10/27/2018,"Luckily we got a table without any wait but subject to returning the table within 1.5 hours...we had delicious scallops as special appetizer followed by squid ink pasta and asparagus risotto. Nice flavors, just right cooking time.! We finished by sharing the tipomisu, not really a tiramisu... more like an intense chocolate cake with salted caramel chocolate sauce. A tad too sweet... will go back anytime to try the other dishes on the menu.  Service was friendly and efficient. And my glass of red (unilitro, Sangiovese) from Tuscany was inexpensive and  easy to drink."
Ian M.,3 star rating,7/13/2019,"I visited on a weeknight with two other people. I had the trout.  Candidly, for the price I felt the establishment was overrated and I was surprised I did not share the same feeling as many other Yelp reviewers which is highly uncommon.  The portion sizes are incredibly small, the place was noisy, and the menu was not very varied."
Jeany L.,4 star rating,10/29/2016,"One of the destination to get the best pasta in Melbourne CBD (no joke). For starter, I had some chef's selection of Salumi followed with Tagliolini and Pappardelle for main. Everything taste divine but I reckon their Tagliolini falls under a must order category. Highly recommend this place for pasta lovers and also to book in advance."
Tiffany Y.,5 star rating,2/3/2016,"Fantastic Italian restaurant. Pasta is freshly made in house. Service was great. They even gave us a free appetizer because we waited an hour and a half. This is a very popular spot, I suggest you make a reservation or put your name down and grab a glass of wine around the corner at Kirk's wine bar. I recommend the gnocchi!"
Kris G.,2 star rating,8/1/2018,"Extremely poor service, walked in and half the place was empty and was told 1 hour wait! Only requested dining for 1 person. Clearly not interested only dollar! Piss poor service! Won't be back"
Moni B.,5 star rating,4/27/2016,"Hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in the Melbourne CBD. The pasta here is what they pride themselves on, and it is to die for. We had the Chef's menu, and by the end of the meal were ready to roll out, because we were so full! The Tipomisu dessert was also a real highlight.The restaurant has gained extreme popularity so it can be difficult to get a booking, but it definitely worth the persistance, there isn't another place in Melbourne like it!"
Vincent J.,5 star rating,6/27/2018,"A must try over the sister restaurant Osteria Ilaria, notches above in food quality. Book in advance or go during the week day as a walk in.MENU: Everything was solid, tried 5 dishes. VIBE: Wait staff were pretentious, however im disregarding this for the quality of the food. Good wine menu.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Tagliolini al nero, truffle risotto (special)"
Angela Y.,5 star rating,9/20/2015,"Don't know why I hadn't reviewed it earlier! Came here for a celebratory meal way back in Feb and did the chef's choice menu, nothing short of AMAZING. We started with some delicious bread and ricotta, arancini balls, the spectacular burrata (the best burrata I've ever had), the squid ink pasta AND the gnocci, the radicchio side salad, and the best interpretation of a tiramisu (frankly the only version I can stomach, I hate every single tiramisu I've ever had) Delicious food, attentive service and refreshing decor. LOVE IT(still craving that squid ink pasta, really ought to head back soon!)"
Otto U.,5 star rating,2/27/2018,"Small restaurant, great ambiance, wine and best Italian food I've had so far in Melbourne. Get there early to snag a table as they fill up quickly."
Jenn R.,5 star rating,6/30/2015,"It's a fairly unassuming little spot, but hugely popular. It's interior is rustic and welcoming, dimly lit and warm. We were told there would be a half-hour wait, but that there's a lovely wine bar up the road, they'll call us when we can eat. Perfect. The wait was almost exact, with one glass just finished as my phone rang.We were tempted to go for the chef's menu, but settled on two entrees and two mains to share instead, and the sommelier and wait staff then helped us pick two wines available in the half bottle that would go with our options. I love half-bottle options, I think more Perth venues should do this! More flavours, same price! The wine list was mainly Italian, not a lot I was familiar with, so the staff knowing the wine inside out was a huge help. Our dishes were the entrée special of the day - wild mushrooms, with smoked wagyu and housemade rosemary crisps and the grilled tongue. The tongue is thinly sliced and concertina'd onto a skewer before being grilled, so it's both aesthetically interesting and has lots of crispy exterior bits as you bite into it. For mains we had clam and smoked tomato spaghetti - my husband is currently obsessed with smoking things, so this was one of the dishes that made us lean away from the set menu. The little smoked cherry tomatoes were fabulous - but there weren't enough of them. I think the dish totalled 10 clams and only 4 tomatoes. The flavours combined so well, but needed more of the sweet smoky bursts of flavour. The stinging nettle and saltbush risotto was vibrantly green in colour and flavour. It was decidedly different, and one of the best risottos I've eatenGiven how much we'd enjoyed the food thus far, skipping dessert was simply not an option, which set a decadent precedent for the remainder of our Melbourne Food Odyssey. Lance ordered the torta del giorno, which was a light and airy white chocolate mousse dish which I remember as being a little lacking in textural variation. My dessert is their signature - the Tipomisu - or their take on the classic tiramisu. It was Oh. My. Gosh. Fabulous. A dense chocolate brownie round filled with sweetened rum mascarpone, topped with chocolate and then smothered in the richest coffee caramel sauce you could imagine. I still have dreams about that sauce. Such an intense coffee flavour, tempered by the caramel, without sweetening it too much and a hint of salt to further round out the coffee bitterness."
Giustino S.,5 star rating,11/3/2015,This is once again one of the best italian restaurants in Melbourne. Great bustling noise makes you feel like you are in italy. Pasta dishes are second to none especially saffron pasta. The set course menu is fantastic value and you get to try the chefs sampling of many dishes. Worth the wait if you didnt book as you can have a drink next door whilst you wait.Definately top 2 in melbourne for pasta.
Suzee Q.,5 star rating,1/16/2018,"Thank you Yelpers!!! We stumbled upon this place on the recommendations of Yelp and we were lucky enough that there was one last lunch table right where we could watch the chef prepare the meals. We were hungry!!! We ordered the burrata to start. I got the cavatelli (casarecce) with sausage and my daughter got the rigatoni (paccheri) with basil and tomato. We also had broccolini and polenta fritta on the side. This was an amazing meal. The pasta was so fresh and the combinations of ingredients was very flavorful. Our waiter was fine - we were enjoying our food so much we just required our waters to be refilled! During our meal we watched the chefs as they worked to prepare all the meals - it was wonderful theatre! To the left of the grill, there is the pasta machine and there was a worker who stood there the entirety of our meal doing nothing but making pasta. Wish we could go back - it was fabulous!"
Evan S.,5 star rating,1/10/2016,I was out fairly late looking for something to eat and found this place on Yelp. Wow. It was so good. Very accommodating from the moment i arrived. I started with the zucchini flowers and then had the gnocchi which I think may be the best I have ever head in my life. Some delicious grilled apricots for desert and a glass of wine to go with each course. Reasonably priced as well for food of such great quality. Will definitely come back again when in Melbourne
Benjamin S.,5 star rating,5/1/2017,"Most delicious Italian food in a long while. The artichoke starters was a feast of subtlety, the eggplant pasta lovely and the wine pear desert with chestnut purée to die for. Very busy but friendly and efficient. Highly recommended. :)"
Sheryn F.,4 star rating,9/7/2018,Great food and attentive service.  Particularly liked the offer of more complimentary (and delicious) bread to mop up the sauce from my seafood pasta dish.
Navi J.,5 star rating,8/2/2017,I travelled all along the eastern coast of Australia and this was by far my favorite restaurant! The location is great and the restaurant itself is very cozy but not too loud. The food is fantastic! I started with the artichoke followed by the spaghettini and I couldn't put my fork down. Dessert was their take on tiramisu called tipomisu which was so innovative and scrumptious. Our server was so attentive and helpful. He made thoughtful recommendations on wine selections which were right up our alley. Wish there was a Tipo 00 in the US! This place is truly a gem.
John P.,5 star rating,7/4/2018,"We ordered the truffle risotto special and the duck gnocchi and both were exceptional. Sometimes truffle anything can be s but overpowering but this dish was perfectly balanced and the same goes for the gnocchi. And to top it off, the staff were great too, right from the person handling the door, who managed to squeeze us in when we had assumed we'd have to look elsewhere, to our waitress, who was just the right level of attentiveness. We'll be back for sure."
Hilary A.,5 star rating,8/26/2016,Really good Italian dishes. We had the duck gnocchi and the Nero pasta. We stopped for a late lunch on a Friday and were seated right away. The staff was quick and friendly and food was delish. Would definitely come back here on our next trip.
Giuseppe P.,4 star rating,8/16/2016,"It is a good  Italian restaurant,  dish is very good and authentic Italian dish!! It's a little bit expensive but fot one is ok! Indicate for special occasions. ....."
O W.,5 star rating,3/16/2016,"Come. This place deserves the rave reviews. From the gorgeous bread, fantastic entrees and scrumptious pasta, I can't fault anything. Except it's really heard to get a spot now !!!"
Jason F.,5 star rating,7/17/2017,Best pasta in Melbourne. But the place is too small and always full. Need to make a reservation before coming to the restaurant and the squid pasta is the best!!
Steph D.,5 star rating,12/5/2016,"This is some of the freshest, best Italian I have had in Melbourne. You cannot beat their handmade pasta! Friendly service and a lovely quaint vibe. Come early or expect to wait for a table though."
Shane N.,5 star rating,4/2/2016,"Tiny, bustling and fantastic. The food blew me away - the fresh cheese and bread to start, gnocchi soft and silken. You shouldn't go past. Fairly authentic and entirely delicious. The only shame is it isn't bigger."
Gerard W.,5 star rating,2/1/2017,"Italian food at its best. We loved this restaurant so much we came back twice in three days! It's delicious! The staff are cool, the wines are great, the food is amazing, and it's very reasonably priced. Yes you will probably have to wait a while to get seated, maybe even a couple of hours, but they'll call you wherever you wander off to. Don't miss this place, very highly recommended."
Seraphine L.,5 star rating,5/17/2017,"Delicious and authentic Italian cuisine.  Make sure to make a reservation beforehand as the restaurant gets busy.  We waited around ten minutes or so without a reservation, but we were lucky.  I had a friendly chat with our waiter about epicsaga - Infinity, which I learned is also quite popular down under!"
Shelli T.,5 star rating,12/17/2015,"Loved the open kitchen and full length windows walking in. Ordered the stunning duck gnocchi. Probably the best pasta dish I've ever had, and certainly the best I've had in Melbourne, which is saying a lot. Well deserved restaurant of the year award win for 2015!!"
A T.,5 star rating,7/5/2016,"Fantastic pastas!!!!! Love the texture and the way the pastas were cooked, as well as the perfect balance between pastas, sauces and condiments. You could literally taste the love, passion and connection between the chef and his dishes. Place has great ambience (not overly modern nor rustic- again just the right balance). The open kitchen help create that close connection between the kitchen and the diners in delivering great pasta heaven. I can't believe I'm awarding a 5-star rating for a pasta place but I'm truly wonderful over. Place is very well patronised so do be prepared to queue to get your table."
Janye A.,5 star rating,7/16/2015,There was a 30 minute wait for a table but they offered to call us when it was ready and we went to the bar next door for a drink. The service was IMPECCABLE. The kind of service that you didn't realise you were missing everywhere else until you experience it somewhere. We ordered the tortellloni and the rigatoni. The tortelloni was stuffed with asparagus and in a cream sauce that had my wanting to wipe my finger on the plate. We cancelled one of the glasses of wine we'd ordered to come out with the food and they still gave us a splash so we could have a taste. Simply divine. Would have loved to linger and enjoy it more but my eyes were hanging out of my head from a huge day of travel and exploring Melbourne.
Peta A.,5 star rating,1/10/2017,"Fabulous food, service was great and a wonderful vibe! Would definitely go back and thanks to Yelp as otherwise we would not have found it!"
Tom Z.,5 star rating,6/18/2015,"A fantastic little spot with charm and exceptional house-made pasta. Tried the Wagyu Bolognese, went back and had it again 2 days later! Perfection & Consistency. Can always rate a place by the quality of wine on pour and there was not a disappointment here either, quite the opposite in fact. Bookings are recommended as it fills up quickly on weekends. Arrived on a Saturday early and was leaving as they were turing people away. They are open all day so a mid week late lunch proved effortless and immensely satisfying. The place is pasta done perfect. Favourite indeed."
Maya G.,4 star rating,1/4/2018,"Strong Italian game. I had the tortellini and they were very fresh and delicious. Also, the bread they serve in the beginning is delicious. I will say, portions aren't huge. Maybe that's just the American in me who enjoys a good sized meal. Also, tables are a bit close together."
Dez R.,5 star rating,2/19/2017,"This restaurant won best new restaurant of 2016, it's a hatted restaurant that gets it name from the flour used to make the pasta. Small in size (seating about 40?), it's unassuming from the outside yet welcoming once you step in. Very hard to get in as a walk in, (we saw many people turned away at the door), I highly suggest you book to secure your seat. They are prompt on FB messenger and email (which is how I ended up booking). Our waiter knew his menu and knew how to look after us. There was four of us, and we all ordered different dishes, three pastas and a steak on the menu. ALL of them where exceptional. Open for lunches and dinners, it's well worth the drive into the city for this authentic well made Italian food. Leave the kids at home, this is proper date night food, or out with friends ""adulting"" as we were. From here we walked over to Om Nom (Adelphi Hotel Melbourne) to have our desert, perfect night for the short walk. Putting this on the list of things to do with out of towners to showcase Melbourne as the walk is past buskers in Bourke St and down lane ways that Melbourne is famous for."
Rachele C.,5 star rating,2/7/2017,"I decided to eat at this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. I am glad that I took a chance because my meal was delicious! I had the gnocchi with braised duck- it was light and tasty. The servers were very nice, friendly and helpful. The place was crowded but we were able to snag a few seats at the bar so I do suggest making a booking or reservation before coming in. The place is definitely trendy. I would definitely be back the next time I'm in Melbourne."
