Nikki W.,4 star rating,2/25/2015,As you know Footscray is all about the Asain food this fits in well with that sub-class. Say hello to some tasty Vietnamese eats for cheap!! Relatively big restaurant with two different sides to the restaurant.If you like spring rollls get your butt here for some fresh tasty spring rolls. Anything you think of that is your favorite dish in this cuisine this will place will most times have it! Food comes out extremely fast and tastes so fresh!Again i said its cheap quick and tasty even has sommmme cheeky beers if its a dinner before a night out.

Grant S.,4 star rating,2/7/2013,"I dont eat Vietnamese food very often (no idea why) but I really liked this place and I will probably start eating here more often. The spring rolls were delicious and cheap and the seafood soup was very very nice. All up the whole meal, including drinks cost about $32 for 2 people.Its nothing particularly fancy - just good quality, fresh food in a nice enough environment. - but then thats just how I like it!"
Niketh K.,4 star rating,12/8/2012,"I love this place the most out of the plethora of Vietnamese places on Hopkins/Barkly. Â I go here for all of my non-pho requests. I love their spring rolls, and the beef with blackbean claypot. Also their Bun's are extremely tasty with the fresh mint and lovely grilled meats."
