Richard H.,5 star rating,7/13/2017,"Best pho in Melbourne!The large pho really is large, and would easily feed two people. But being the people we are, the gf and I ordered a large each - and won. The soup is the best I've had both in Sydney and Melbourne, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Bursting with flavour, it's the perfect food for a cold and rainy day. The price is very reasonable for the quantity and quality as well. Definitely will be back when we're in Melbourne again!"
Carl C.,4 star rating,7/10/2019,"I came here with a terrible flu and I needed the nourishment that only pho could provide me. I don't usually order the chicken pho since most places don't do a great version of it but I took the chance because I thought it would've been better for my health. Luckily, the version here is really good.The broth tasted super clean, with a nice heat from what tasted like fried shallots or onions. The chicken was also very moist and it came with a lot of noodles. I couldn't finish since my appetite was small from being sick so I took the rest of the broth home to enjoy again later. The broth alone helped me feel better when medicine and rest couldn't."
Danny T.,5 star rating,1/7/2015,"I reckon these guys are now the best in town. Followed by Chu The (Richmond), I love pho, superbowl. Like most restaurants I am finding that the successful Pho joints always encounter inconsistency issues. This place however has been one of my favourites for a while. it was nvr one to be striking or out there in terms of flavour like the I love Pho (when it was first started) and the superbowl. They have a distinct broth. These guys use a sweeter broth and u don't need a gallon of water to hold down ur forced msg addiction. it maybe b masked but they sure do a good job of making it taste 'homely'. Pho Hung Vuong 2 and Chu The (Richmond) have been quite consistent in my weekly Friday eatings."
Jenni M.,3 star rating,6/3/2018,"This location has moved just down the street to 108 Victoria Street, still in Richmond.Had the vegetable pho which was pretty good. I can't speak for their traditional beef pho but the place was packed so they must be doing something right."
Dahokolomoki Z.,5 star rating,12/30/2016,"Awesome pho! I've had more than my share in the London pho scene, so I like to think I know a good pho when I see one. And they don't come better than this. Generous portion (small at $10 is all you need) and an amazing soup base. So clear and light, yet so flavourful. The shop is pretty casual and Hawker style, but for the price and quality you can't complain.The crystal prawn rolls were also delicious, worth 5 stars on their own too.They only take cash, so make sure you have some when you go!"
Craig T.,5 star rating,12/6/2015,"Pho-king great PhoCash onlyon Victoria StreetSo I have been looking for good Pho for awhile, and it turns out that I had to travel to the Southern Hemisphere, no, not to Vietnam, but to Victoria, Australia, Melbourne ways.So after a long day of sight seeing, our guide took us to this quirky area of Melbourne full of Asian markets and Vietnamese restaurants on Victoria Street. There is street parking but we had to hunt around a bit. I didn't notice any car parks around, which is typical of any older area in a city. So we were greeted immediately when we walked in and luckily there was one table available. The clientele was pretty mixed with Vietnamese speaking to English speaking which always makes me feel good about a place if the clientele is from the country of origin of the cuisine. I ordered the number 2 beef brisket along with an order of veggie spring rolls. Our order came out pretty quick and the consomme was amazing. Clear and very meaty tasting. The noodles were cooked firm, and the brisket wasn't to thin or thick. The side of veggies to mix in the soup was fresh, especially the bean sprouts. I donno, maybe because I was hungry it tasted so great. The spring rolls had incredibly fresh veggies inside and the wrapper wasn't dried out in the corners, like they make these to order.Glad they took cash so I could use some of the Australian currency I exchanged. Too bad this place isn't near my house."
Centripay ..,5 star rating,3/9/2018,By far the best Pho I had between Melbourne and Sydney. The broth was done perfectly and packed so much flavour!!!! I hardly needed to add anything to it! Service was quick and friendly even though the place was packed. The portion sizes are huge! so choose moderately. I ordered a medium and It was the perfect start to my day.
Monica H.,4 star rating,7/23/2014,"I almost don't want to say how good the pho is here because this place is already pretty busy and I want to keep it for myself. How often do I come here you might ask? Probably once a month for the last 5 years. More when I'm hungover. Less when it's hot.They recently refurbished it here and I prefer the old layout but it looks newer and cleaner. Pho still tastes great. The price recently went up so now it's $8 for a small, $9 medium and $10 for a large. I always get the rare sliced beef and the odd occasion will add tendon or tripe. Pretty much tried every single pho place on Vic St but always end up back here. Others have better atmosphere, tea and service but for the pho itself.. This broth is the best and I will always come back here.Warning: Be prepared to be really really thirsty after you have a bowl of this deliciousness though... Like really thirsty.. And maybe in a msg coma..."
Natalia G.,5 star rating,7/2/2018,Probably the best pho on this street. Make sure to get the off menu item pho with raw beef. The broth is to die for bc you know a good pho from the broth
Emma M.,4 star rating,7/16/2016,"Great prices, concise menu, flavoursome stock, quick service, fresh ingredients, bean shoots/basil/chili/lemon plate included with pho, free tea as you sit, cosy 'pho style restuarant' atmosphere. Love it!The only thing that let it down was the bun that we ordered lacked flavour - probably stick with the pho."
Clarissa Y.,5 star rating,4/19/2012,"Let me explain something to you here - when walking down Victoria Street and confronted with the fact that there are over 120394792837410239 pho shops lining the street, it is hard to make a well-informed decision.So... here you are, grasshopper. Prepare to receive advice from the master of picking out a good restaurant from something much less savoury. This advice can also be applied to any trips you take to Asia.HOW TO SPOT A GOOD PHO RESTAURANT:~ Tiny.~ Nearly no effort will be made to create a nice ambiance. Could be someone's house with tables and chairs for all that matters.~ Shit customer service. As in, they don't really smile - ""Give us the money and we'll give you the food"" mentality.~ Brimming with Asians slurping up their pho.I guarantee such a place will serve up the best pho you will ever have. Why? If you've ever played a videogame such as the Elder Scrolls series or something similar, each restaurant receives a certain amount of mastery points they can stack in a specific skill. A good pho restaurant decides ""fuck it"" to ambiance and customer service and just stacks their points in making some damn delicious noodles.Also, I do place an emphasis on the fact that the characteristic ""brimming with Asians"" is actually important. Think of it as a rule of thumb - who knows authentic and delicious pho better than the Vietnamese themselves? Their tongues are trained to seek out only the best, and now it is our jobs to follow their lead."
Glen G.,4 star rating,2/17/2014,"Very good pho in Richmond. Grabbed a bowl of the beef combination and was quite happy with it. The broth was full of flavour, the noodles had good consistency, and the various meat items were all good quality. Would happily go back."
A T.,4 star rating,6/23/2015,"Ga simply geat bowl of pho!!! The pho has the right soft texture. The broth was beautiful (although I would prefer it to be less salty - my personal preference). Really a tough act to match, especially in this part of town ie pho galore. The spring rolls were also good too. Cannot go wrong with this place"
Steve D.,4 star rating,4/10/2012,"I don't know what goes on in the kitchens of these pho places, but I always visualise an ancient Vietnamese lady stirring an industrial-sized vat of pho with a rowing oar. Having said that, I have a theory that said vat (which may or may not exist) needs the seasoning of age to produce killer pho. Hear me out here. Pho Chu The up the street used to be the joint. Then they got fancy, changed the name to I Love Pho and moved two doors down. Now hipsters slurp soup from a presumably clean, new vat. As soon as they moved, quality dipped. And I'm putting it down to hygienically clean kitchen appliances. Little Saigon was also killin it. Then the place burned down. As soon as they reopened (with a new kitchen), I noticed a decline in flavour. This can't be a coincidence.Meanwhile, Pho Hung Vuong are still servin' soup from the same old stained, dirty vat (which may or may not exist). And the result is the tastiest pho in the street. I just hope this place doesn't burn down. Or the old lady with the oar doesn't keel over and drown in the vat."
Lauren S.,4 star rating,5/23/2014,"I do not usually venture past my westside doorstep for Pho but a trip to Richmond lands me here.  There was not a huge amount open at 10:30am on Victoria street but this place was packed so I thought it was worth a try and I was't let down at all.  I ordered a small beef pho no noodles as always (yeah yeah I am used to the strange looks)  The broth was lovely, clear and fragrant and the meat was thin and lean.  What more could I ask for? Oh friendly service?  Yes I got this as well.  Whilst I will probably not drive this far for my usual pho fix this is a great place that I will not forget!"
