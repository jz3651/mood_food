V C.,5 star rating,6/8/2018,"Blissful degustation at +39 PizzeriaSo glad to finally pay a visit to one of the most established Italian eatery in Melbourne.  The name +39 itself actually refers to the telephone area code in Italy... and what a gifted name it is! As the food here certainly connects customers to an authentic Italian culinary journey. The restaurant is pretty easy to find, nestle just across Tip00 on a busy-passed lane of Little Bourke Street. Venue-wise it is rather spacious and me quite fond of the interior design; homey, relaxing atmosphere adorned with vintage decorations. During my visit, there was a modest wait time, but since I travel solo, I had the luxury to be seated right away *lucky*. For my lunch, I ordered + 39 Pizzeria pride and joy: The blue swimmer crab spaghetti, it arrived in gorgeous presentation and was insanely delicious. The crab was sweet and juicy and paired with the semi crispy house made spaghetti and coated with garlic chili, Napoli sauce and lobster bisque - A burst of flavor in the mouth that makes my palate dance! I literary couldn't stop munching it.  It was nothing less than a stellar dining experience at Italia +39. Their food is seriously fantastic from beginning to the end, and to be completely honest, it's been a few months since my last meal at Italia +39  Pizzeria and I still couldn't get over how delicious every single thing are! Beautiful food, lovely ambiance and classy service. Salute."

The pizza was immaculate and at a great price point for the quality and taste. The Margherita was my favourite and was very delicious. I recommend this place."
Elle N.,5 star rating,1/19/2020,Decided to check out this pizza joint as it had many reviews and was just a couple of minutes from our hotel! My god what an amazing pizza joint! We decided two get two pizzas: Margareta and tartufata with a side of truffle mushroom cheese dipping sauce for our pizza crust and we destroyed everything! The ambiance and wait staff were extremely attentive! We were lucky to not have to wait long! Would highly recommend to anyone whose in Melbourne to come try it out!!

Sheenal S.,3 star rating,6/18/2016,"Saving my carbs for the winter season I was looking forward to gorging on pizza, pasta and all things Italian at this place. The menu items are in Italian, the wait staff are Italian and you are welcomed with a glass display window showcasing delicious prosciutto and the kitchen smells are fabulous.So you expect primo service and food. Service was definitely primo - quick and friendly staff. However, food was not bene at all. The polenta chips with gorgonzola dip were just fried polenta (no flavours) and the gorgonzola dip was just melted gorgonzola. The margherita had a minimal number of basil leaves on it, the sauce quantity was minimal and even lacking in some areas on the pizza but the crust was nice and salty. The black linguine with seafood was quite disappointing. Firstly yes points for having mussels, calamari and prawns but omg did they empty the entire bottle of Italian salt in the pasta. All we could taste was salt. Two bottles of water later,  we still couldn't get the salty taste out of our mouths. Only a shot of tequila after remedied our taste buds. Wow. Never have I had so much salt.Also if you use pay pass on your visa debit card, expect to pay a credit card surcharge. Seriously."
Mercedes L.,5 star rating,12/1/2019,"Wow, just wow! I don't know if it was just fatigue from traveling or hunger but this place is absolutely one of my favorite pizza places now. The pizza and salad were amazing. I had the VIP and Insalata Mista and though I usually prefer to diversify my food choices while traveling I may have to pay them another visit before leaving."
Gilbert C.,5 star rating,11/11/2019,"Italia +39 was a pleasant little parlor with the right ambience. The shop was full of patrons with a small line leading out the front door. The wait was well worth it when I decided to order the Diavola pizza. The serving is for a hungry single person or two looking to try the pizza. The dough, sauce, cheese, and topping were all fresh and delicious. I highly recommend eating here at least once if your in the business district of Melbourne."
Joanna H.,5 star rating,3/23/2017,"After a lot of Yelp searching +39 Pizzeria won the vote for a late long-lunch in Melbourne on a hot sunny day. This authentic restaurant fulfilled all my Italian dreams from the decor, wait staff and of course, food and drinks!The rose was cold and absolutely perfect with the margarita pizza my boyfriend and I shared for our starter. The crust was chewy and thin and it stayed hot for a long while, although it didn't take us long to finish it. Simplicity at its best.I ordered the prosciutto and mascarpone ravioli and not only was it aesthetically pleasing, the fresh, homemade pasta was cooked al dente and the mascarpone was thick and creamy. It was an absolute delight. My boyfriend had the spicy cod marinara and he fell in love. Service was impeccable and it was the perfect spot for a lazy lunch."
Dara H.,5 star rating,6/29/2019,"We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday and almost wasn't seated due to not having a reservation.  The restaurant was packed, but luckily they were able to squeeze us in.   We ordered a margherita pizza and rocket salad.  Ingredients in both items were high quality. The pizza was hot and salad was fresh.  Service was attentive as well.  Highly recommended but I'd make a reservation."
Dean N.,5 star rating,8/17/2016,"Well worth a trip into the city, you must book, the Margarita was the nicest one I've ever eaten and the quatro fromage with blue cheese just heaven. If there is better in the suburbs, I've never heard of it. Put this place on your bucket list, it's a big two thumbs up from me. Made to a standard not to a price."
