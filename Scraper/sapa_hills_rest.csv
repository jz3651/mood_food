Food I.,1 star rating,7/5/2021,"Sapa Hills used to be my go to Vietnamese restaurant in Footscray. The food was amazing and it was very reasonably priced. However, I hate to say that they no longer focus on flavour and quality of the food. Their main focus is making the restaurant as aesthetic as possible. Don't get me wrong, the decor and ambience of the restaurant is nice, but with this they have increased prices and decreased taste and quality."
Nigel V.,4 star rating,11/30/2018,Cracking food and a killer beer list. Staff are wonderful. Young bloke knows his beers and is interested in our beer tastes. WINNER. Worth a return train trip just to visit.
Amita S.,4 star rating,10/12/2014,"Came here for breakfast. Got crab banh canh (crab rice drop noodles) and the other half had pho bo. Place is super clean and love the decor. The restaurant also has that lovely char grill smell that took me back to one of my fave restaurants in Sydney (hai au in canley vale for those wondering). The banh canh was good. The basic broth was good and got better once I added the usual condiments. The pho bo is also good, but to be honest have had better. I think is place is a good all rounder vietnamese restaurant. The cafe sua da is reeeallly good that was the stand out item!I'll come back again and try out the spring rolls though!"
Leisha C.,5 star rating,12/8/2013,"So there's this amazing transport invention called a car. I finally have one again after 5 years and making the most of it by driving out of Moonee Valley to eat. Last nights trip took me to the lovely suburb of Footscray for a pre Vietnam holiday Vietnamese dinner, and to Sapa Hills thanks to Yelp. Dirt cheap,  classy Vietnamese in Footscray. Check out the look of the place next door, you'll know why I'm calling this classy. $10 mains, amazingly good rice vermicelli, some of the best prawn spring rolls I've tasted and really good service have given this my stamp of approval. In fact I might go back tonight."
Lauren S.,5 star rating,4/4/2014,"I love to try new things, do not get me wrong but when somewhere is as consistent and delicious as Sapa Hills I find myself walking past loads of Vietnamese restaurants in Footscray and heading back to this awesome favourite.  Sapa Hills was the first semi trendy Vietnamese to hit Footscray and their food, fast service and friendliness won me over.  The secret is out re this place and I would definitely book ahead especially if dining for more than two people.  My protips here are to order the Sapa Hill spring rolls and to try the duck stuffed with prawn meat.  It is to die for!!!  I have to say Sapa Hills is my go to for Vietnamese in the west :)"
Joe M.,4 star rating,11/29/2014,"Back for round 2, up another star and very close to 5. Only slight let down was a chicken dish I can't remember the name of. It is close to, if not the best Viet I've ever had. The Sappa special spring rolls are amazing."

Samantha H.,4 star rating,10/5/2011,"So here's the thing, Footscray gets a bit of a bad rap in Melbourne town. As I didn't grow up here, I sort of liken it to Kings Cross in Sydney. A heartbeat from the GPO, I can only image it's some sort of oldschool inbred thinking that means people don't like the place. Sure, if you're looking for pristine and aristocratical (is that a word? is now.) you're not going to get it in Footscray. But if you're looking to feel like you discovered a rip in the time/space continuum and walked straight into Vietnam, this is where you go. In a hustling, bustling area full of Asian grocery stores (you won't find a more authentic wok anywhere) and pho restaurants snuggled alongside Ethiopian cafes and African hair salons it takes a lot for a particular place to stand out. Spend any sort of time in the area though and you'll quickly notice there are some clear favourites amongst locals. Sapa Hills is a new kid on the Hopkins Street block, but it's quickly become so popular they're often forced to turn people away. Their claim to fame is pretty simple. They only use fresh produce. Nothing is frozen, premade or prepacked. Despite at least 20 other options in the street, this is my favourite place for a pho fix. And at under $10 a pop, can you blame me?"
Courtney C.,5 star rating,6/8/2013,"I wish it wasn't so far from home, I would eat here as often as I could! A fresh dining experience for Footscray, the sister restaurant to Hawthorn. The service was impeccable, our waiter's enthusiasm for the menu was contagious. There is a great risk of over ordering here, due to the interesting menu options and large portions. I had a standard Beef Pho, but it certainly wasn't standard. It was magnificent, the best I have had since travelling Asia. Really unexpected for me due to living on a street with 9 other Pho restaurants! The duck pho was divine. For the price I could barely believe the quality of experience that we received. Could not recommend enough for fans of fresh Vietnamese!"
Kenneth W.,5 star rating,5/8/2016,"Yummy food and great quality.  Service is good and clean restaurant.  Very new and clean toilets, which says a lot about hygiene.  Food prices are a little steep for Footscray with most dishes around the $17-$22 mark and rice or noodle dishes around $13-$17.  However the quality of the food was absolutely delicious.  Would highly recommend and definitely going back again!  We were there on a Saturday around 3pm and the place was still packed!  Very friendly and attentive staff!"
